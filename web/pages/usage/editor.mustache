<p>You can use AwesomeTTS to just add or update audio files one-by-one. This
  method will store the generated audio files with your Anki collection,
  allowing synchronization.</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<ol>
    <li>From the note editor, activate the input field to which you would like
      to add the audio <samp>[sound]</samp> tag.</li>
    <li>Click the speaker icon in the toolbar.</li>
    <li>Select your desired service and configure any options.</li>
    <li>Confirm that the input phrase is correct.</li>
    <li>Click &ldquo;Preview&rdquo; to confirm that your audio is as you would
      like it to sound.</li>
    <li>Click &ldquo;Record&rdquo; to insert the audio clip in the field.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Hints</h3>

<ul>
    <li>AwesomeTTS will automatically populate the input field of the note
      editor dialog with whatever was already in the active note field when
      you opened the dialog. If it was empty, AwesomeTTS will try to populate
      the input field with whatever is in the system clipboard. The options
      you set on the <a href="/config/text">Text tab of the configuration
      screen</a> will apply to this.</li>
    <li><a href="removing">Mass removal of audio can be done via the card
      browser</a> later if you decide you do not like the audio you have
      added to a set of notes.</li>
</ul>
