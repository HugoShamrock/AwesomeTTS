<p>AwesomeTTS supports two methods for text-to-speech playback:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>&ldquo;On-the-Fly&rdquo; Playback</strong>, where you insert
      special <code>&lt;tts&gt;</code> tags into your <em>card templates</em>.
      These special tags are understood by any <em>desktop</em> Anki client
      with AwesomeTTS installed. No media files are stored or synchronized
      with your collection, and audio is produced on-demand as you review your
      cards.</li>
    <li><strong>Stored MP3 Audio Files</strong>, where you record the speech
      for your cards ahead of time, inserting <code>[sound]</code> tags into
      your <em>note fields</em>. Once generated, these tags are natively
      understood by <em>all versions</em> of Anki, even without AwesomeTTS
      installed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most users will pick one method or the other, but some users may choose to
  combine them. Which method(s) you choose will depend on where and how you
  use Anki, how complex your collection is, how much fine-tuning you like to
  do, and possibly other factors.</p>
