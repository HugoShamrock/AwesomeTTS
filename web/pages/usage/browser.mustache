<p>AwesomeTTS can generate many audio files for the notes of the cards you
  select in the browser. This method will store the generated audio files with
  your Anki collection, allowing these to be synchronized along with your
  cards to mobile devices.</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<ol>
    <li>From the card browser, highlight the cards whose notes for which you
      would like to generate audio.</li>
    <li>Select your desired service and configure any options.</li>
    <li>Type a sample phrase and then click &ldquo;Preview&rdquo; to confirm
      that your audio is as you would like it to sound.</li>
    <li>Select the source field from the dropdown menu that you would like
      AwesomeTTS to read from.</li>
    <li>Select the destination field from the dropdown menu where you would
      like AwesomeTTS to store the <samp>[sound]</samp> tag (or path).</li>
    <li>
        Indicate whether you would like to <em>append</em> or
        <em>overwrite</em> this field with the result. If you want to keep
        the text you already have, select <em>append</em>. If you want to
        remove the text entirely and replace it with the sound, choose
        <em>overwrite</em>.

        <ul>
            <li><em>If appending</em>, you may choose to add additional
              <samp>[sound]</samp> tags rather than cleaning up old ones by
              unchecking the &ldquo;remove existing&rdquo; option.</li>
            <li><em>If overwriting</em>, you may choose to store the path to
              the audio rather than the <samp>[sound]</samp> tag by unchecking
              the &ldquo;wrap the filename&rdquo; option.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Click &ldquo;Generate&rdquo; to begin processing. You can cancel
      processing mid-batch if you need to.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that if one of the cards&rsquo; note in your selection does not have
  both the source and destination field as specified, it will be skipped.</p>

<p>If you make a mistake, you can undo your batch update by going to the
  <kbd>Edit</kbd> menu and selecting the <kbd>Undo AwesomeTTS Batch
  Update</kbd> option.</p>
