<p>The easiest way to add TTS to your cards is to edit the template(s) they
  use to wrap a <kbd>&lt;tts&gt;</kbd> HTML tag around the text you want
  spoken. You can use the normal Anki template placeholders within these tags.
  Additionally, you may opt to hide all or individual <kbd>&lt;tts&gt;</kbd>
  tags if you want to display something else or nothing at all (e.g. for
  listening comprehension cards).</p>

<p>To toggle automatic playback of the <kbd>&lt;tts&gt;</kbd> tags or to
  change the shortcut keys, go to the On-the-Fly Mode tab of the configuration
  screen.</p>

<p>This option is best for users who only need TTS playback while using the
  desktop version of Anki. Users who use Anki on mobile devices (e.g. with
  AnkiDroid) may want to use one of the other methods.</p>
