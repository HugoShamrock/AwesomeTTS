    <figcaption>&ldquo;MP3s&rdquo; configuration tab</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The &ldquo;MP3s&rdquo; tab allows the user to manage how the
  <a href="http://lame.sourceforge.net" rel="external">LAME transcoder</a>
  is invoked and how to rate limit online services.</p>

<h2>LAME Transcoder</h2>

<p>AwesomeTTS uses <a href="http://lame.sourceforge.net"
  rel="external">LAME</a> to transcode from raw audio formats to MP3s, which
  are stored on the file system for both playback and recording.</p>

<p>If you are a power user, you can specify exactly which flags will be passed
  to LAME here. See the <a rel="external"
  href="http://lame.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/lame/lame/USAGE">LAME command
  line usage guide</a> for what flags are available.</p>

<p>Note that changing this option does <em>not</em> retroactively affect old
  MP3s that are already generated, including those in the cache and those that
  may already be stored in your collection. Depending on the nature of your
  change to the flags, you may want to regenerate collection MP3s or you may
  want to <a href="advanced" rel="next">clear your cache</a> for the flags to
  take full effect.</p>

<h2>Download Throttling during Batch Processing</h2>

<p>When downloading from the Internet, AwesomeTTS is <em>very</em>
  conservative by default about how many requests it will send to a particular
  service. If you do not share a public IP address with other users and wish
  to speed up the <a href="/usage/browser">Browser-based mass generation</a>
  of MP3s, you can tweak the throttling settings here. Be cautious, however,
  as some online services may block you if you issue too many requests close
  together.</p>

<p>Note that a single input phrase might actually result in several downloads
  being requested against a service, even though AwesomeTTS assembles a single
  MP3 afterward. Each of these downloads counts individually for the purposes
  of evaluating throttling during batch processing. For example, a service
  with a <strong>100-character limit</strong> might require <strong>3
  downloads</strong> for a <strong>250-character</strong> input phrase.</p>
