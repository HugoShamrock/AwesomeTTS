<p><a href="http://translate.google.com" rel="external">Google Translate</a>
  is an online text-to-speech service offering high-quality playback in many
  languages. An Internet connection is required to use Google Translate from
  AwesomeTTS.</p>

<p>Because Google Translate is a public Internet service, mass generation of
  MP3s using the <a href="/usage/browser">tool in the Card Browser</a> is
  rate-limited. If you would like to tweak this behavior for your installation
  of AwesomeTTS, go to the <a href="/config/mp3s">MP3s configuration tab</a>
  and look for the &ldquo;Download Throttling&rdquo; settings.</p>
