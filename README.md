# AwesomeTTS

AwesomeTTS brings text-to-speech functionality to [Anki](http://ankisrs.net),
with support for several local and web-based TTS services.

More information and documentation for using the add-on can be found on its
[website](https://ankiatts.appspot.com). User reviews of the add-on can be
found on its [AnkiWeb add-on page](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/301952613).

This repository holds two interconnected projects:

- [AwesomeTTS add-on code](addon/), which runs within Anki
- [website and update API web service](web/), which runs on Google App Engine
  and helps users get the most out of the add-on

[GitHub](https://github.com/AwesomeTTS/AwesomeTTS) is the primary and official
host for the repository and its issue/pull trackers, but there are also
mirrors at [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/corpulentcoffee/awesometts) and
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/corpulentcoffee/AwesomeTTS).
